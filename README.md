# InfoSecLab ETHZ 

This repository contains my solution to the modules proposed in Information Security Lab in Fall Semester 2022 at ETH Zurich. 
I reached the following percentages with these solutions (of which only 6 were accounted for the final grade, the worst one is discarded):

Module 1 100.00 %
Module 2 100.00 %
Module 3 70.00 %
Module 4 100.00 %
Module 5 100.00 %
Module 6 100.00 %
Module 7 100.00 %

> Due to the considerable amount of time it took to get them to work, no cleanup or refinement has been done

Credit for all exercises goes to the course Information Security Lab HS2022 (263-0009-00L) at ETHZ.
